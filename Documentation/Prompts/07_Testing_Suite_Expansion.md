# ðŸ§ª Testing Suite Expansion
**Purpose:** Enhance test coverage per Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md standards and Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md testing strategy

**Usage:** Add comprehensive tests achieving GPT-API quality standards with proper validation and coverage tracking

**Workflow:**
1. Review Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md current test coverage gaps
2. Analyze Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md testing requirements  
3. Create/expand tests/ directory with comprehensive test suites
4. Add unit tests for all routes/, utils/, assistants/ modules
5. Implement integration tests covering full API workflows
6. Add performance tests validating Documentation/05_Development_Roadmap.md targets
7. Create security tests covering Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md security measures
8. Run complete test suite validating all functionality
9. Update Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md with new coverage metrics
10. Commit with test coverage improvements documented
11. Push with full test suite validation

**Directories Referenced:**
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite (create/expand)
- `routes/` - API endpoint testing
- `utils/` - Utility function testing
- `assistants/` - AI integration testing
- `Documentation/` - Testing standards, coverage tracking, quality metrics

**Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive test suite with improved coverage, proper documentation, and quality validation.

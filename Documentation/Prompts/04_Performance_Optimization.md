# âš¡ Performance Optimization
**Purpose:** Enhance performance following Documentation/05_Development_Roadmap.md targets and Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md guidelines

**Usage:** Optimize code with benchmarking, testing, and documentation updates per GPT-API performance standards

**Workflow:**
1. Benchmark current performance using Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md metrics
2. Identify bottlenecks in routes/, utils/, or core components
3. Implement optimizations following Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md patterns
4. Add performance tests measuring specific improvements
5. Validate Documentation/05_Development_Roadmap.md performance targets met
6. Update Documentation/04_API_Reference.md with performance notes
7. Update Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md with new metrics
8. Commit with performance improvement documentation
9. Push changes with benchmark validation

**Directories Referenced:**
- `routes/` - API endpoint optimizations
- `utils/` - Utility performance improvements
- `main.py` - Core application optimizations
- `Documentation/` - Performance targets, metrics, architecture guidelines
- `tests/` - Performance benchmarking suite

**Expected Outcome:** Measurable performance improvements with proper benchmarking, testing, and documentation updates.

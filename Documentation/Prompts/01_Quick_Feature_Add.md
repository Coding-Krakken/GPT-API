# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Feature Add
**Purpose:** Add new API endpoint following GPT-API architecture patterns from Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md

**Usage:** Implement new route in routes/, test via Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md standards, commit following Documentation/07_Change_Log.md format

**Workflow:**
1. Create route file in routes/ following patterns from existing modules
2. Add to main.py router registration
3. Write tests following Documentation/03_Feature_Inventory.md coverage requirements  
4. Update Documentation/04_API_Reference.md with endpoint details
5. Test endpoint functionality and authentication
6. Commit with semantic version following Documentation/07_Change_Log.md
7. Push changes to repository

**Directories Referenced:**
- `routes/` - API endpoint implementations
- `utils/` - Authentication and shared utilities  
- `Documentation/` - Architecture patterns, API reference, testing standards
- `tests/` - Test suite (create if needed)

**Expected Outcome:** New endpoint integrated with full documentation, testing, and version tracking per GPT-API standards.

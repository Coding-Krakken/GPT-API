# ðŸ§¹ Codebase Refactoring & Cleanup
**Purpose:** Improve code quality per Documentation/08_Copilot_Vision_Blueprint.md standards and Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md patterns

**Usage:** Systematic codebase improvement maintaining Documentation/ standards while enhancing maintainability and performance

**Workflow:**
1. Review Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md code quality metrics
2. Analyze Documentation/08_Copilot_Vision_Blueprint.md coding standards
3. Audit current codebase in routes/, utils/, assistants/ for improvement opportunities
4. Identify code duplication, inefficiencies, and pattern violations
5. Refactor following Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md architectural patterns
6. Enhance error handling consistency across all modules
7. Improve type hints and documentation following established patterns
8. Optimize imports and remove unused code/dependencies
9. Update tests to reflect refactored code while maintaining coverage
10. Validate all functionality remains intact through comprehensive testing
11. Update Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md if patterns evolved
12. Update Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md with improved quality metrics
13. Commit with refactoring details per Documentation/07_Change_Log.md
14. Push with functionality validation and quality improvement confirmation

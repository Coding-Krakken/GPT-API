# ðŸ”’ Security Enhancement  
**Purpose:** Implement security improvements following Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md security patterns

**Usage:** Add security feature per Documentation/03_Feature_Inventory.md roadmap, test via Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md

**Workflow:**
1. Review Documentation/05_Development_Roadmap.md Phase 1 security priorities
2. Implement in utils/auth.py or new security module following patterns
3. Update all affected routes/ endpoints with new security measures
4. Add comprehensive tests covering security scenarios
5. Update Documentation/04_API_Reference.md with security details
6. Run security validation tests
7. Update Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md progress tracking
8. Commit with security-focused version bump per Documentation/07_Change_Log.md
9. Push with security validation confirmation

**Directories Referenced:**
- `utils/auth.py` - Authentication system
- `routes/` - Endpoint security integration
- `Documentation/` - Security roadmap, architecture, API reference
- `tests/` - Security test suite

**Expected Outcome:** Enhanced security implementation with full testing, documentation updates, and progress tracking.

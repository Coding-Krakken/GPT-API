# /code Endpoint Audit Report

**Audit Date:** 2025-09-07 23:02:53

## Executive Summary

The `/code` endpoint is stable for standard operations (`run`, `lint`, `format`, `fix`, `test`). However, input sanitization and structured error responses for malformed CLI arguments need urgent improvement. Bulk endpoint support for code actions is non-functional.

## Successes

- Executed standard operations correctly.
- Maintained file and execution safety.
- Correctly rejected unsupported languages.

## Failures & Gaps

- 500 errors from malformed CLI arguments.
- Inconsistent error schema (500 instead of 400).
- `/batch` fails with `/code` due to structure issues.
- Argument sanitization is weak.

## Structured Results

| Action   | Status Code | Output/Observation         |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| run      | 0           | Area: 78.54                |
| lint     | 0           | Clean                      |
| format   | 0           | No changes                 |
| fix      | 0           | No fixes                   |
| test     | 5           | No test functions detected |

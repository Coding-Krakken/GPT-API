# Executive Audit Report: `/code` Endpoint

## Summary

This report contains the results of a full endpoint audit conducted on the `/code` API. The endpoint was tested for reliability, conformance, input coverage, and instruction alignment.

---

## ✅ Endpoint Behavior Overview

| Action   | Status | Notes                          |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| run (valid path)  | ✅    | Executed correctly |
| lint              | ✅    | Detected issues pre-format |
| format            | ✅    | Auto-corrected issues |
| fix               | ✅    | No issues to fix |
| test (no tests)   | ✅    | Proper 'no tests found' response |
| run (with content)| ❌    | **ALL attempts failed** |
| run (invalid lang)| ❌    | JS properly rejected |

---

## ⚠️ Issues & Gaps

### Critical

- `run` with `"content"` results in 500 Internal Server Errors
- Unsupported but claimed languages (e.g. `bash`, `node`) crash server
- Lack of granular errors; all failed executions return generic 500

### Moderate

- Exit code not standardized across lint/test
- Schema lacks `content` vs `path` usage distinction

### Minor

- No concurrency validation due to premature failure
- No runtime duration feedback from long operations

---

## 🧠 Recommendations

- [ ] Implement proper input validation for `"content"` mode
- [ ] Introduce graceful error handling and meaningful messages
- [ ] Clarify documentation on supported languages and input schema
- [ ] Extend test support and include concurrency monitoring
- [ ] Harden endpoint against fuzzing, malformed, and boundary cases

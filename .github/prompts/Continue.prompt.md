# ðŸ”® Vision Implementation Next Step
**Purpose:** Advance toward next milestone per Documentation/05_Development_Roadmap.md and Documentation/08_Copilot_Vision_Blueprint.md

**Usage:** Implement next strategic capability following GPT-API evolution path with comprehensive testing and documentation

**Workflow:**
1. Review Documentation/05_Development_Roadmap.md current phase priorities
2. Check Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md milestone progress
3. Select highest-priority unimplemented feature from Documentation/08_Copilot_Vision_Blueprint.md
4. Design implementation following Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md patterns
5. Create new modules in appropriate directories (routes/, utils/, assistants/)
6. Implement with security-first approach per Documentation/02_Technical_Architecture.md
7. Add comprehensive tests covering all scenarios and edge cases
8. Update Documentation/04_API_Reference.md with new capabilities
9. Update Documentation/03_Feature_Inventory.md status matrix
10. Update Documentation/06_Traceability_Matrix.md progress tracking
11. Test integration with existing system thoroughly
12. Commit with milestone advancement documentation per Documentation/07_Change_Log.md
13. Push with vision progress validation

**Directories Referenced:**
- `routes/` - New API endpoints for advanced features
- `utils/` - Enhanced utilities and frameworks  
- `assistants/` - Advanced AI capabilities
- `Documentation/` - Vision blueprint, roadmap, architecture, progress tracking

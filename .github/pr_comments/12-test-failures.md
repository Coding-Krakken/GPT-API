### :rotating_light: Automated Test Failure Report for PR#12 :rotating_light:

@copilot

#### Summary
- After running the full test suite on this branch, **108 tests failed** (out of 352), with the majority failing due to `403 Forbidden` and `{"detail":"Invalid API key"}` responses from the API.
- Some tests also failed with assertion errors, unexpected status codes (404, 500), or import errors (now resolved).

#### Key Issues
- **API Key Rejection:** Most endpoint tests are failing because the API is rejecting the provided API key(s) as invalid.
- **Other Failures:** Some tests fail with 404/500 errors, assertion mismatches, or missing dependencies.
- **Initial ImportError:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'` (fixed by installing `requests`).

#### Example Error Output
```
AssertionError: /system/ GET failed: {"detail":"Invalid API key"}
assert 403 == 200
...
```

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run all tests from the project root:
   ```fish
   pytest
   ```

#### Recommendations
- Ensure the correct API key is set and accepted by the backend.
- Review authentication logic for recent changes.
- Update tests to match current API expectations.
- Fix all failing tests so the suite passes cleanly.

### :rotating_light: Test Failures Detected in PR#12 :rotating_light:

@copilot

#### Summary
A recent test run on this branch resulted in **54 test failures**. The failures span a variety of endpoints and features, including authentication, API key handling, endpoint responses, and feature-specific logic.

#### Notable Failure Types
- **API Key/Authentication:** Many tests fail with `{"detail":"Invalid API key"}` or status code 403. Ensure the correct API key is set and accepted by the backend.
- **Assertion Errors:** Several tests expect specific fields or values in responses (e.g., `'MISSING_FIELD'`, `'normalized_keys'`, `'latency_ms'`, `'result'`, etc.) but receive different or missing data.
- **KeyError/500 Errors:** Some tests encounter missing keys in responses or server errors (500), indicating possible backend bugs or unhandled cases.
- **404/Not Found:** Some endpoints or resources are not found as expected by the tests.

#### Example Failures
```
FAILED tests/test_apps.py::TestAppsEndpoints::test_geometry_operations_validation - AssertionError: assert 'NOT_FOUND' == 'MISSING_FIELD'
FAILED tests/test_full_api.py::test_endpoint[/system/-GET-None-200] - AssertionError: /system/ GET failed: {"detail":"Invalid API key"}
FAILED tests/test_gui_control.py::TestWindowManagement::test_list_windows_detailed - assert 500 == 200
FAILED tests/test_safety_enhanced.py::TestAuditLogging::test_audit_query_with_filters - KeyError: 'result'
FAILED tests/test_screen_enhanced.py::TestEnhancedScreenCapture::test_performance_metrics - AssertionError: assert 'latency_ms' in {'errors': [{'code': 'CAPTURE_FAILED'}]}
... (see full log for all failures)
```

#### Instructions
- Investigate and resolve **all test failures** before merging this PR.
- For API key issues, verify the test and backend are using the same key and that the key is valid.
- For assertion and KeyError failures, ensure the API returns the expected fields and values as per the test contracts.
- For 500/404 errors, check for unhandled exceptions or missing routes/resources.
- Rerun the full test suite (`pytest`) after each fix to confirm resolution.
